README: Java Case Studies

1. Supermarket Billing System (For Loop)
----------------------------------------
This program automates the billing process for a supermarket. It asks the cashier how many different items
the customer bought and for each item requests the item name, price per unit, and quantity. Using a for loop,
it calculates the subtotal for each item and sums them to get the grand total. If the grand total exceeds 50,000,
a 5% discount is applied. The program then prints a receipt showing each item’s details, the grand total,
discount (if any), and final amount payable.

2. Student Grading System (While Loop)
--------------------------------------
This program records student exam marks without knowing in advance how many students will participate.
It repeatedly asks for a student's marks (0–100) and assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F) using if–else statements.
The input continues until the lecturer enters -1, which stops data entry. The program immediately prints each
student’s grade and keeps track of total students, number of passes (marks ≥ 50), and number of fails.
After completion, it prints a summary showing total students, pass/fail count, and the class pass rate as a percentage.

3. Class Attendance Tracker (Do-While Loop & Arrays)
----------------------------------------------------
This program helps a class representative (CR) record daily attendance for a class of fixed size.
It first asks for the total number of students. Using a do-while loop, it records daily attendance and stores
it in an array (up to 30 days). After each entry, the CR can choose to continue or stop. After data entry,
the program calculates the average attendance, identifies days where attendance was below 50% of the total class size,
and prints a summary table listing attendance per day, average attendance, and the percentage of days with low attendance.
